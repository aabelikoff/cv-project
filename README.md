My first app created with React js library.

It allows to create cv, which is based on using different forms.
User has a possibility to save cv in pdf format and its printing.
Also there is a possibility to save data in json in local storage.

Three languages are possible to use. Every cv in proper language could be saved in local storage.
For loading particular cv just select language you want to be cv loaded.
